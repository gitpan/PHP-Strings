    Use the C<\Q> regex metachar and L<split|perlfunc/"split">.

        my @pieces = split /\Q$separator/, $string, $limit;

    See L<perlfunc/"split"> for more details.

    Note that C<split //> will split between every character, rather than
    returning false. Note also that C<split "..."> is the same as
    C<split /.../> which means to split everywhere three characters are
    matched. The first argument to C<split> is always a regex.
