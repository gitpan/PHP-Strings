name: chr
docs: |
    PHP's and Perl's L<chr|perlfunc/"chr"> functions operate sufficiently
    identically.

    Note that PHP's claims an ASCII value as input. Perl assumes Unicode.
    But ensure you see L<the documentation|perlfunc/"chr"> for a precise
    definition.

    Note that it returns B<one character>, which in some string
    encodings may not necessarily be B<one byte>.
