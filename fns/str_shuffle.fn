    Implemented, against my better judgement. It's trivial, like so many of
    the others.

requirements:
    List::Util: 1.13

code: |
    sub str_shuffle
    {
        require List::Util;
        my ( $string ) = validate_pos( @_, STRING );

        return join '', List::Util::shuffle split //, $string;
    }
